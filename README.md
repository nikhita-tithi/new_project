## Getting Started

Install the node modules to get started

Please note: I could only see the figma frame with hand tool and not the pointer(requires login & access), so the styles are closely estimated as the actual style information on style viewer couldn't be accessed for component styles and measurements on figma.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
